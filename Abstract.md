## Abstract

QuickNotes is an intelligent note-taking app for Android that rethinks personal organization via AI-powered auto-tagging. I built this app for my software design class to solve my own frustration with disorganized notes. Traditional note apps force chronological organization with manual folder management—inefficient for daily use. QuickNotes eliminates this problem by automatically categorizing notes using OpenAI's API while maintaining full user control.

The app leverages modern Android architecture (MVVM, Material Design 3) to deliver a seamless experience. Users can create notes normally, and the AI instantly suggests relevant tags based on content analysis. Features include notification reminders, manual/auto tagging, and reliable local storage. The AI integration demonstrates practical machine learning in mobile development, solving everyday organizational issues with contemporary note-taking apps.

Since submitting QuickNotes as my semester-long project, I have continued to refine and iterate on the app. The biggest of such iterations was a switch to the MVVM design pattern instead of MVC, requiring a major rewrite of the application.
