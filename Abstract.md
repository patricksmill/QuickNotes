# Poster Abstract

For my software design class, I was assigned the task of creating an Android app. I wanted to create an app that I would see myself using every day. I brainstormed a few ideas and put a list of some I liked into the default notes app on my iPhone, to which I found was horribly organized. No easy organization system to decipher types of notes. Everything was group chronologically, and the only way to organize was to create folders. This was fine for the occasional note, but I needed a better way to organize my notes, which is why I decided to make QuickNotes.

QuickNotes is a note-taking app that makes it quick to create, edit, and organize your notes. Adding a note is as simple as pressing a button.
