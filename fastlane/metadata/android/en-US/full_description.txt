QuickNotes helps you capture, organize, and review ideas quickly.

Key features:
- Create, edit, and delete notes with instant search across titles, content, and tags.
- Apply tag-based filters to focus on the ideas that matter right now.
- Enable optional AI-powered auto-tagging by providing your own OpenAI API key.
- Schedule reminder notifications so you never miss an important thought.

QuickNotes is free and open source. Set up goes fast—install the app, add your notes, and personalize reminders in just a few taps. Your data stays on-device unless you choose to use AI-assisted tagging via an external API key that you control.
